    <p>I received this email as a member of a Juniper group within Google, and I was a bit blown away by the fact that someone, first of all, would be willing to pay someone else to get them certified. But then I realized after some thought, while consulting with some of the knuckleheads that I have had to work with that have &gt; 5 certifications all from different vendors, and couldn’t possibly due the work they were hired for. Honestly. I’ve seen it and been dumbfounded by the amount of coin they were pulling in and then they would have me do the work. Awesome.</p>

<p>Is this the end of how certifications are valued? I of course have NEVER thought highly of certifications. My biggest reason is because so many test questions are so loaded and NEVER straight forward and are so subjective that you have to guess what {Enter Vendor Name Here} wants instead of interesting factual information. &lt;!@%^%$#&gt; I hate tests but not enough to be a &lt;!@%^%$#&gt; &lt;!@%^%$#&gt; to pay someone to take a test for me.</p>

<p>So, without further delay:</p>
