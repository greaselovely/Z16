## My Initial Career and Transition to IT

When I moved to Denver from Roswell in October of 1993, I got a job within a month working at the AMC Colorado Plaza 6 theater at S Colorado Blvd and Alamesda.  It has been a 24 Hour Fitness for a long time now.  I worked as a Supervisor and a Projectionist there for a while.  All this while I prepared to start school Spring of the following year.   

In 1994, I started to attend Colorado Institute of Art (CIA) for Music and Video Business where I got into production work within a year.  While going to school I heard of a job opportunity at a company just down the road on S Colorado that the owner of Second Spin, a music store, had opened.  This NEW company converted film to video, scanned images and saved them digitally, and even did some very light weight video production and editing.  They had invested in a Video Toaster!

I learned to use the Video Toaster a bit while I had down time and made some absurd edits with my own home videos from Roswell.  [Example](https://youtu.be/qsHS83ecRTU){:target="_blank"}.  The owner of Second Spin was a real asshole and I left there within a short time.  When Second Spin eventually had to close, it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.

I eventually had to leave the theater, mostly due to the shooting that happened there.  I was on duty as a supervisor and in the lobby when the morons started popping off.  The new management that came in after was gaslighting me about my reaction to it, which was absolutely nothing.  

But off to my new career I went.  While doing random things for work, I once did a job for free for a woman I met at Denver's Public Access Television.  The Public Access Television had a building over in Five Points in Denver.  I was doing volunteer / intern work there while also going to school and working other places.  I wish I could remember her name, but she let me help out and I was happy to do it!  I was then told that I'd be picking up the grip truck from LSI early Saturday morning and that I'd meet Eileen to get the truck and drive it to location.  My memory of Eilenn, who was also volunteering for this shoot, was that she was pretty curious and very nice.  She was asking me all types of questions about lights and the stands, and what the little flaps on the front of the light did (the barn doors), and I showed her as much as she wanted to know.  I didn't know her and I didn't care, I was happy to be involved and to be along side people doing the same.

Turns out, Eilenn was married to a man named [Ken Seagran](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0780481/){:target="_blank"}.

Ken owned a little company called **Lighting Services Inc.**

So, I started working at Lighting Services Inc (LSI).  Eilenn knew that I was in school still, and she offered to pay my tuition, which I gladly accepted.  I took her up on this until I realized that I was wasting my time and our collective money.  The school was teaching a lot of bullshit and I was learning more on the job that I was in school, so I quit school and worked full time.  

LSI used to be a ridiculously large sound stage and lighting company located at the corner of Alameda and Cherokee in Denver. This building prior to that was once a canning factory.  The factory used to allow trains to go into the building which presumably was for loading the trains for moving product. Stage 1 and some of the other parts of the building at that time still had the old train tracks running through it.  The building is long gone and standing in its place is a giant apartment / condo building.

My job at LSI involved loading trucks, moving electrical cables and lighting to stages, and doing the occasional production work on set.  LSI was also the home to a very large prop studio and all kinds of crazy things were hidden in the back, including a "dailys room" that also contained a film projector.  Old tech companies like Storagetek used to bring in there giant tape silos and set them up to do film production for promotional purposes.  Bud Light once built a GIANT pirate ship on stage 1 and shot a commercial there.

At one point, I had the opportunity to work a production out of state, where I was responsible for the grip truck and headed to Arizona by way of Moab.  I had to go through the mountains during winter with a loaded grip truck.  This is where I developed my hate for snow season combined with mountains.  

This was for a commercial for a company I had not heard of before or since.  And when I tell this story out loud, I get the `ohhh...`.  The commercial was for `Shane Jeans` and was shot all in Monument Valley, and had a decent budget but very small crew.  One morning we were up early and sitting in a parking lot waiting on a helicopter to arrive so we could mount the camera in it for arial shots.  

I got to do a lot of cool random shit at LSI, but there was its fair share of hard labor too.

LSI eventually employed a very old stage hand named Ron.  Ron was a union guy, when it mattered, but was largely unemployable.  And as it has been established, Ken and Eileen have very big hearts, so they put him on the dock overseeing us rookies.  Ron was a caustic and toxic individual.  He actually was a better alcoholic and chain smoker than he was a dock manager.  Ron also had his fair share of health issues, not excluding the giant goiter on his neck and his numerous missing teeth, alongside his thinning hair that had not been in proximity to shampoo in a very long time.  I can still hear the sound of his voice in my head, because we got so good at making fun of it.  His missing teeth didn't allow him to make the `f` sound at all, he could only muster a `p` at best.  So, in your head, I want you to whisper loudly and make it raspy as hell, and say `puuuuuck`.  You get the drift.  That was Ron.  I quit because Ron was an alcoholic asshole.

After that I worked for a company called **Film/Video Equipment Service Company (F/VESCO)**.  I was hired to work in their much smaller lighting department that was also responsible for camera cranes, remote heads, camera dollies, and was also responsible for repairing it all as well as the repair or building of new sealed lead acid battery packs in an array of types, most of the time we put them in small flight cases that were so popular back then.  I worked there for around 4 or 5 years, and did a lot of cool shit.  Went to LA to learn how to repair the Super PeeWee camera dolly at Chapman / Leonard.  I learned to operate a Steadicam.  I even was responsible for the main design and engineering of what became known as the Camryde (one of the worst names to be used in marketing).  Video [here](https://youtu.be/2E_tKkhn3EI){:target="_blank"} and [here](https://youtu.be/Fl8gtuHBeH0){:target="_blank"} for your enjoyment.  Additional engineering and fabrication was done by FX West in Denver.  I secretly wanted to work at FX West but wasn't smart enough back then.

During my early days at F/VESCO, they were using Apple Mac II SE's and were networked together using RJ11 cable (telephone cable) and the protocol was AppleTalk.  They had dot matrix printers that were connected directly to a couple of the computers.  On these machines they were using FileMaker Pro as their rental and sales database.  Which honestly, at the time, was an amazing piece of software.  Very extensible, very easy to understand and modify.  More on that later.

When customers came in to rent, buy or have something repaired, they would use this crazy small network of Macs to print out to the dot matrix printers the customer's receipt or rental contract on multi-part carbonless paper.

At some point, Dean's `IT guy` (they weren't even called IT guys then), his name was Kevin. There was another Kevin G. who worked in the Camera Support department that I eventually took over for when he went to work for Sachtler out in New York; not the same Kevin is my point.  So, Kevin had talked Dean into converting from the Apple Mac II SEs (they were getting old for sure) and moving to a Windows based system.  Dean agreed and Kevin went to a local computer store over on S Broadway called Sileo Computers (pronounced sil-ee-oh). He had Sileo build the machines, install Windows 95 on the desktops, and a server installed with NT 4.0.  Kevin then eventually picked up all of these machines and brought them to the office, placing them all in the conference room right behind the reception desk.  There they sat for what now feels like forever. 

Now, we had heard there was going to be a migration to a Windows network, but it just never happened.  There was a really smart video engineer who worked on all of the broadcast and ENG video cameras named Tom S.  Tom and I eventually got tired of waiting for this to happen, so we went to Dean and told him that we would get this done.  He said fine.  Actually, he probably said something to the effect of `you're fucking me, you're all fucking me`, which is a classic Dean-ism, and then agreed to `let` us do it.  

This was the actual moment that I began my career transition.

While all of the computers sat in the conference room, we got some of them turned on and started trying to understand what we just got ourselves into.  Ultimately the main project was to get FileMaker Pro to function no different than it had before.  We were able to figure out how to get the database copied over onto the Windows machines and started working in FileMaker to get formatting correct.  Primarily as it relates to the printers.  Dean very much wanted to maintain the use of the multi-part carbonless paper on the dot matrix printers.  The paper that he had was also pre-printed with the company graphics and had lines printed on them for each line item of the contracts that were printed.  Each line contained the description of what was being rented or what item was in for repair and what to do with it during repair.  So we needed to get the lines correct within the software.  And you'd think that it would be a straight copy and it would just work.  Not the case, but it saved us a lot of time to get it done, but it was a lot of fine tuning.  It allowed me to understand the software a lot and made me realize what else we could do with it.  So it was mostly formatting the pages that I worked on initially prior to migrating.  But I got it.

I'll spare many details of my recollection of the work performed even though it was very interesting to me that I got to do some new things.  The work is still very vivid in my head.  However, I recognize that it's actually uninteresting to you the reader to have me blather on about how I had to figure out what CAT5 was, how we ran the CAT5, how I had to go learn to terminate CAT5, how I had to learn to test CAT5 after learning about 568A and 568B wiring standards, and realizing I had not terminated them correctly and had to re-terminate over half.  How I had to learn what a network hub was (long before we had switches).  And then how I had to quickly try to figure out subnetting and why some of the new network laser printers didn't work over the network since, as I quickly learned, they were not on the same network subnet.  I'll also spare some details of the DSL we had (very new internet technology for our office) and how we had to figure out how to allow internet access from all of the computers out this DSL line (I can even still see the UFO like shape of the DSL modem).  I'll continue to spare some details on learning how to get NT 4.0 operational, how to get this new server and its operational role as a `Primary Domain Controller (PDC)` understood, and then install MS Proxy 2.0, which was still in the box, onto the PDC and then get it connected as the gateway for the rest of the network.  I did all of that without any formal training. 


## Um, what?!
"Sorry, did you say that you placed your PDC directly on the internet with only MS Proxy 2.0 to allow traffic out?"  

You read what you read.  That happened.  I exercise my right to the brief ignorance I had of network security.  Almost up until I was at a friends house where they had Comcast Cable (the name may have been something different, I can't recall).  But these were the days where it was a giant broadcast domain and you could see a variety of things on the cable network, including network printers.  This is where my eyes opened, and when you start sending print jobs to printers in someone else's home, that's a thing.

I eventually couldn't take any more toxicity from Dean, or him yelling at his brother Jerry in front of everyone, or his constant yelling at us how we were `fucking him`, so I quit.  Went and did some brief work for a company called **Remote Broadcasting Inc (RBI)** and did some jobs where I was the Engineer In Charge (EIC) for the broadcast truck that was rented.  I shot the Mexican National Soccer Team, [Chivas de Guadalajara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.D._Guadalajara){:target="_blank"} when they played in Colorado and then traveled to Chicago to play in Soldier Field.  I did a shoot in Casper, WY for [The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jerry_Lewis_MDA_Labor_Day_Telethon){:target="_blank"}.  But it didn't last long and finally landed a job full time in IT at New Horizons.

And let me tell you what, New Horizons did the EXACT same thing that I did at F/VESCO with their network using MS Proxy 2.0 on their PDC, except I didn't do it and by this point knew better.  

Solid tip for you; MS Proxy 2.0 doesn't care if you want to get into the admin share of the PDC from the internet.  Ask me how I know.  

Hint: Setting the boot timer in the boot.ini file to -1 halts the boot of NT 4.0 and it just sits on the boot screen until a selection is made.  Where if you are crafty enough, you can place a message there for the next person at the console to give them the ultimate pucker.
