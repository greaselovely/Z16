### When a CRM Vendor Tells You to Try Someone Else

I recently revisited WORKetc while evaluating PSA/CRM platforms for **Zero One Six Security, LLC**. They seemed like a promising all-in-one solution, so I figured it was worth seeing how far they’ve come. Spoiler alert: not far.

I reached out with a basic presales inquiry — nothing wild. Just the standard: *“Can I talk to someone to confirm that the platform supports the workflows I need before I waste time in a trial?”* Seems reasonable, right?

What I got in return was a masterclass in “how not to do presales.”

> *“We recommend exploring other CRM systems that offer phone support.”*
> – The WORKetc Team

No phone support. No attempt to route me to someone who could answer questions. Just a flat “good luck.” I replied, pointing out that it’s a waste of both our time if I spend 14 days trialing a system that may not support quoting, procurement, or other fundamentals. But they doubled down. If I wanted help, I’d need to figure it out through a trial on my own.

Now, I’m not asking for steak and champagne — just someone to spend 15 minutes helping me decide whether to even bother.

So to WORKetc’s credit… I took their advice. I’m exploring other platforms. And I’d suggest you do the same.

**TL;DR:** If a vendor can’t be bothered to talk to you before you become a customer, don’t expect that to improve once you are one.
