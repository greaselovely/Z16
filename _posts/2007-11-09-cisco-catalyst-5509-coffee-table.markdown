This is our end result. An out of service (though still operational) 120 lb Cisco Catalyst 5509 chassis. This replaces a 4 legged open metal base as the original base of the table. The felt pads that are seen on the corners are supporting and protecting the glass on top of the chassis. In the middle of the table, under the glass, a glass chess board.

The blades are seperated and the slot covers removed to provide space between each blade which become sliding shelves.

Ultimately, this table cost us a whole $3.50. I didn't buy the glass, chess set, or the switch. Not a bad deal I'd say.
