In case you are looking for them, here are the OID's for CPU and sessions within ScreenOS.

I'd like to get a better list of OID's.  I mean, I imported the MIB's into the SMNP tool I was using, but I can't find any good resource OID's.

CPU Utilization
1.3.6.1.4.1.3224.16.1.3.0

Session Counters
1.3.6.1.4.1.3224.16.3.2.0
