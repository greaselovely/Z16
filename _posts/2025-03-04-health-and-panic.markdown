Not the blog post or overall idea I was going for when building this out.

I've been ill since we got back from our family vacation in Cancun in early January.  The day after I got home I had a fever and then proceeded to follow up a few days later with a covid test, which was negative.  After not getting better within the week, I reached out to the doc and was seen.  They did a flu A+B test, all negative.  I had received both vaccines a few months earlier and while I wouldn't be surprised if I had contracted it I was confident that it was going to come go if so.  But alas, nothing.  Ultimately I asked for more albuterol and started breathing treatments at night.

Then for no explicable reason the rest of the family became ill with cold or flu or who knows what.  Fen got better pretty quick but the wife also continues to linger.  I do not believe that I got them ill, since I work at home 100% of the time with occasional outings, but they are out in public almost daily.  Nonetheless, they got sick and it messed things up around here.  On top of which Kelly went to Vegas for work and got something during that trip and basically spent this last weekend in bed and on the couch and is once again a absolute mess.

After not getting better or seeing improvements from the albuterol and the constant production of gross, I called the doc again.  She sent me for a X-Ray of my chest.  Diagnosis was that there isn't anything 'remarkable', no signs of pneumonia.  Again, nothing.

Waited a bit longer and still not much improvement.  Called the doc again, and she referred me to a pulmonologist, who I was able to provide a small sample of gross to him for the lab, and then he set up an order for a CT scan, and a pulmonary function test which is coming up.

In the mean time I can't sleep, my sinuses are trashed which makes it near impossible to breath while sleeping, and then my lungs get congested and I can't do anything with air at that point any way.  

This morning, I have to admit, I am struggling with panic.  I had a coughing fit that didn't produce much, which then caused me to be very low on air intake and I got and am freaked out.  This is f***ed and I am scared today.
