# CB Radios
Growing up in the desert of NM didn't come with a lot of perks.  No one was in charge of my entertainment and did we ever quickly realize that.  So there's a lot of trouble a person can get in if they wanted to.  And there's ton of opportunity if you have an extremely curious mind. 

My mother had a CB radio in her Nissan pickup, and had two dual antennas on the mirrors.  I didn't pay too much attention to it as an early kid, but it was in her truck for the entire time she had it.  I venture to guess she didn't put it in, but that it came with the truck when she bought it.

I got a bit older and got curious and started playing with it.  That quickly turned into a small obession of mine, especially when you convince your friends that they need one (at least one).  And then we all had one in our cars, and then we all had one in our homes.  It was bananas.  That quickly grew into learning about antennas and I built a dipole antenna between the little place I lived in and the very old storage house next to me.  It really wanted to work.  And here's why it didn't.  It's established that I'm curious.  And it should now be established that I can be impatient.  I wanted to just build it and see if it worked.  I had the rough estimates on the length and to insulate as needed, but I suspect I cut corners on this.  That's not the point of this.

CB Radio led me to eventually getting my HAM license.

# HAM Radio

In 2003, I was finally ready to drive down and take my FCC exam for my HAM license.  I decided that I wanted to go to Manitou Springs to take the test.  I convinced my then wife and my 2.5 year son that we should go down, and once I passed the exam that we could go fart around and eventually go back home later that day.  I took and passed my exam, and spent the next 10 years playing around, but never committed to it.

I found that the HAM community felt a bit cliqueish and never connected with anyone and so it went largely unused.  I did do some events with the boyscouts where we went camping and they would make contacts over the air, or they would see what slow scan TV looked like.  We did some fox hunts and showed them what a directional antenna looked like and how to use it.  Using an old tape measure and cutting the metal tape to size and arranging it using PVC worked like a charm.

I didn't renew my HAM license in 2013 and it officially expired in 2015.  But today I sat down and took a practice test at [HamRadioPrep](http://hamradioprep.com){:target="blank"} without even reading much and got a 71% which was encouraging because I hate tests and the self-burdened implication of failing one.  So maybe I'll get my license again for fun.  

# Software Defined Radio (SDR)

I am sitting here talking myself out of buying (for the umpteenth time) a KiwiSDR kit.  I want to put one up and play with it and have people connect to it and listen to RF in the Denver metro area.  The fantasy plays out in my head just as if I were sitting in Japan wanting to hear random things in the US.  That's me when I go look at the [KiwiSDR map](http://rx.linkfanel.net/){:target="blank"} and see all of the online receivers that are can be accessed for free via the web browser and just listen to the mosts random things.  It's like [Radio Garden](http://radio.garden){:target="blank"} for extreme nerdlings.

Please do yourself a favor and play with those.  It's a load of fun.

# Number Stations

You simply should start to [DDG](http://www.duckduckgo.com){:target="blank"} for Number Stations.  And then go look at YouTube for Number Stations.  

And then, you should then open up [Priyom](https://priyom.org/number-stations/station-schedule){:target="blank"} and watch for upcoming scheduled transmissions of known transmissions.  As I write this, I'm listening to JP7FSO in Fukushima, Japan and it is receiving a Russian number station broadcasting on 9322 AM USB.  

They are still using number stations for the presumed reason of communicating with spy assets across the globe.  Dude!
