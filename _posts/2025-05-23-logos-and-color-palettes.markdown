There’s something deceptively difficult about choosing a color palette and designing a logo for a new business. At first glance, it seems like a straightforward task: select a few colors, sketch a basic mark, and apply it across your materials. But when those choices are meant to carry the weight of your business identity, the pressure builds quickly. These aren’t just colors and shapes.  They’re the first impression, the tone, and the personality of your brand.

The mental toll comes from trying to make the “right” choice. Will customers take you seriously if it’s too playful? Will it feel sterile if it’s too safe? Every color has a connotation, every font a voice. You start second-guessing your instincts, wondering what will resonate with your audience versus what feels authentic to you. It’s an emotional tug-of-war between personal taste, design trends, and market expectations.

Then there’s the practical side. The palette and logo you choose have to work everywhere, from business cards and websites to quotes, contracts, and pitch decks. What looks great on a dark background might fall apart in print. Fonts need to be readable. Colors need to reproduce consistently. You start to realize that visual identity isn’t just creative work, it’s functional design that has to scale and adapt. And when you’re the one making every decision, it’s exhausting trying to get it all right.
