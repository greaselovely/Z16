The systems team at AC was heavily vested into using Lenovo for servers and endpoints.  Lenovo then got into network switching and routing so I tinkered.  It wasn't my favorite stuff.  And for those that care, if you're going to say to your customers `it's a Crisco CLI` then you haven't differentiated yourself.  And to capitulate to a neckbeard in some basement who won't learn a new CLI syntax, then you deserve to be forgotten because they will stick to the original instead of buying store brand.
