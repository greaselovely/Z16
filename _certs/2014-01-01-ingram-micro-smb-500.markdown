Ingram Micro was one of our distributors early on at AC.  They quickly became one of the distributors that we killed our relationship with after not honoring our refund due to a mistake on their part.  It was a lot of money but it would have cost us more to sue.  They aren't a favorite of mine to this day because of this.  And these were handed out like candy I'm sure of it.  Largely useless wallpaper.
