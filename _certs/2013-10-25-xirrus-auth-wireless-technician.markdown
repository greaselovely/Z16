So I had some not so good experiences with Brocade when they cycled through some relationships with other WLAN manufacturers, the likes of Motorola which was difficult, and even their own hobby kit looking WLAN APs.  

But before they landed on Ruckus, we were approached by Xirrus to sell their products.  They had an interesting idea.  Imagine the ability to put in 8 APs into a single chassic and hang it on the ceiling.  Now, it wasn't small but it wasn't excessive either.  

Xirrus is now owned by Cambium Networks
