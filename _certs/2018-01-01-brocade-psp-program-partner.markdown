After Brocade purchased Foundry, and many years after they finally got their partner program squared away, they created the PSP program.  The Professional Services Parnter program, which recognized specific partners that could deliver Pro Services (design, implementation, administration, integration).  This ended up being an 'invite only' list, you couldn't request access to it. The teams in various territories voted on which partners were allowed in on the list and I was extremely surprised to find out that we were invited.

It was also a requirement of the PSP entry to be technically vetted by technical staff at Brocade.  So somehow we passed and were given this.  The date on this post is made up because there isn't a date on this certificate and I can't remember when we received it.

I'd like to say that this resulted in us getting more business based on our capability.  I'd like to say that this gave us more business in terms of new customer referrals from Brocade.  I'd like to say that customers cared about this.  I'd like to say that Brocade didn't steal business away from us after being referred to us by the very same company.  I'd like to say that Brocade didn't protect us for certain large opportunities that they knew we were in on `cough Colorado College cough`.

Nope.  None of that happened.  But I was proud nonetheless.
