There was a guy by the name of Jon J who worked at Brocade as a Server Load Balancer (SLB) guy, and he strongly encouraged me to get certified in Brocade SLB.  He promised me lots of leads if I did.  So I did.  And got zero leads.  Awesome.  Also sold zero SLBs even after trying on my own.  Womp womp.

Again, no date on this certificate so the date on this post is made up
