In the very early days of discovering who Juniper Networks was the VAR I was working with at the time, The Illumen Group owned by Enrique Krajmalnik, decided that we (they) wanted to become an Elite partner with Juniper.  The requirements to do that is that we had to have 2-3 technical staff members with certificates as well as sales staff (which included the same technical staff that did pre-sales work) to have sales certificates.

We worked our tail off to get the certs done.

The only way I became a fanboy of Juniper was when they acquired NetScreen.  I was then introduced to JUNOS and their routers and was pretty stoked.  This was of course before they attempted to make the SRX play like NetScreen before killing that product altogether.  And for the history buffs, the SRX debacle still echos loudly as of this post. 2/22/25
