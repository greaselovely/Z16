Juniper was the first reseller agreement I signed at AC.  I wanted to strive for more business from Juniper as I had been selling the occasional J-Series and Pulse Secure VPN solution.  Fun fact, I had helped implement the SSL VPN boxes when they were Neoteris prior to NetScreen buying them in 2003.  I was a HUGE fanboy of this product.  

Hoping that I would gain attention from Colorado territory sales people by leveling up a bit, I worked on getting my certs again.  Turns out, that was a waste of time.  Juniper sales people, and for that matter higher leadership, gave two shits about my small business and what I attempted to do for myself and Juniper.  So they focused 100% of their attention on Elite partners and I never heard from them proactively.  So I stopped selling their product (mostly, again...HUGE fanboy).  I also started working with Palo Alto Networks NGFW before this certificate and had decided to focus on that product line instead.
